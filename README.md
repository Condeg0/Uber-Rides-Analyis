# Uber Data Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of Uber ride data from April 2014 to September 2014. Containing data oon over 4 million Uber rides in New York City, this project aims on providing visual insights into ride patterns based on various time dimensions and geographical locations.


# What the Application Does
This application aims to analyze Uber ride data to uncover patterns and trends. Specifically, it:

* **Visualizes trip distributions**: It shows the number of trips across different hours, days, and months.
* **Highlights peak times**: Identifies the busiest hours and days for Uber rides.
* **Maps ride density**: Plots the geographical locations of Uber rides to show areas with high ride activity.
* **Creates heatmaps**: Displays heatmaps to visualize the concentration of rides based on time and location.
* **Analyzes base activity**: Compares the activity levels of different Uber bases over time.


## Why These Technologies Were Used
* **R**: The primary language for data analysis and visualization due to its robust statistical capabilities and extensive library support.
* **ggplot2**: Used for creating complex and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
* **ggthemes**: Provides additional themes to enhance the visual appeal of plots.
* **lubridate**: Simplifies the handling and manipulation of date and time data.
* **dplyr**: Facilitates data manipulation and transformation with a clear and concise syntax.
* **tidyr**: Helps in tidying data, making it easier to work with.
* **scales**: Assists in formatting scales and labels in plots.
* **DT**: Used for rendering data tables in an interactive manner.


## Challenges Faced
* **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the date and time formats were consistent across all datasets.
* **Handling Large Data**: Managing memory and performance issues when working with large datasets.
* **Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations that effectively communicate the insights derived from the data.
* **Time Factorization**: Accurately splitting the date-time column into multiple time-related factors.
